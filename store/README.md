<h1 align="center" id="title">Store</h1>

<p id="description">The goal of this project was to acquire the ability to create server applications with an external client.

The final system is a full-stack web application that simulates an online store.  It consists of two main parts: a backend server that provides an API and manages the database, and a frontend client that allows users to interact with the store.

The backend server is responsible for managing the store's database, providing endpoints for the frontend to interact with the data. It handles tasks such as retrieving product and category information, managing the shopping cart, and simulating the purchase process.

The frontend client provides a user-friendly interface for users to browse products, filter by categories, add items to their shopping cart, and simulate the purchase process. It communicates with the backend server via the provided API, allowing for a seamless user experience. Users can also manage orders and products in the store.</p>
